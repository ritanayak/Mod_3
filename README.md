## Reflection

### How did using Figma designs as references affect your coding process?
Using Figma designs as a reference made my coding process more structured and efficient. It helped me translate visual components into clean HTML and CSS while maintaining consistent spacing, typography, and layout
across mobile and desktop designs.

### What challenges did you encounter when aligning your code with the design specifications?
Achieving pixel accuracy while keeping the layout responsive was challenging. Small details such as spacing, font sizes, hover states, and focus styles required careful adjustments to match the design while
maintaining accessibility best practices.

### How can the feedback and community resources on Frontend Mentor help you improve as a developer?
Frontend Mentor’s feedback and community resources help identify areas for improvement and expose different approaches to solving the same problem. Reviewing others’ solutions and receiving feedback encourages
better coding practices, accessibility awareness, and continuous learning.
